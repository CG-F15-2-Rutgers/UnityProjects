Part 1 README

Explanation:

This simulation demonstrates the ability of agents to navigate through an obstacle course filled with mazes, obstacles that are non movable, and obstacles that can move. The agents can be selected by clicking the left mouse button on a red capsule, and then right clicking in the direction the object must move. Left clicking on more than one object will select more than one capsule. Afterwards, if a destination is set, all capsules selected will move towards that destination. Navigating through the obstacle course can be done by moving the camera by using the numbers 1-7 on the keyboard. Pressing the space bar will clear all agents currently in a list of agents. Pressing the 'r' key will reset the level. Red objects can be moved by selecting the red object with the left click, and them moving them with up,left,down,and right arrow keys. A and D keys will rotate the object. 

User Guide:

1. CAMERA MAP NAVIGATION
	a. Use number keys 1-7 to change camera positions.


2. AGENT NAVIGATION
	a. Select agents with left mouse button, then right-click towards a point to navigate them in that direction.

	b. All agents will navigate towards area which was right-clicked: If agents are selected, navigated, then list is cleared and process is repeated, ALL agents will go towards that one destination.

	c. If right click is held after units are selected, units will follow the location of the right click so long as it is pressed down!
	d. To clear list of selected agents, press space bar.
	e. If agents stop moving among navigation, select destination again and they will move to it.

3. MOVABLE OBJECTS
	a. Red Objects are Movable, Select them with left mouse button then use keys left arrow, right arrow, up arrow, and down arrow to move them. Rotate them with A and D keys.
