PART 3 README:

This implementation is extended from part 1. See Part 1 README.txt for further explanation.

What differs from part 1:

To animate the agents, I imported the character prefab and added all components from the capsule agents to it.
I set the parameter vertical_speed to 1 when the right mouse button is clicked to begin the walking animation through the animation controller.
